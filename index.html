        <p>Ecuador lives in the middle of the Equator, it's climate is probably tropical. Ecuador is lovely place to visit, you can view valcanoes,mountains and islands.Ecuador is a beautiful country and it is located in South America. The capital city in Ecuador is Quito.One of their top visits are Galapagos islands, I have heard they have fresh coconuts.Did you know that if u put an egg on the equator on Ecuador it would start to boil?Ecuador is amazing and you should take a vacation over there.</p>
